# Hancho

班長, hanchō - "Squad leader”, from 19th c. Mandarin 班長 (bānzhǎng, “team leader”)
Probably entered English during World War II: many apocryphal stories describe American soldiers hearing Japanese prisoners-of-war refer to their lieutenants as hanchō.


Hancho is the smallest build system I can make that fits my needs.
It focuses on a small set of features:

1. Easy construction of commands via Python f-strings
2. Minimal, parallel, fast rebuilds.
3. Zero "magic spells" - everything is completely explicit.

Hanchō should suffice for small to medium sized projects.
