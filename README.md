# tinybuild
Tinybuild is the smallest build system I can make that fits my needs.
It focuses on a small set of features:

1. Easy construction of commands via Python f-strings
2. Minimal, parallel, fast rebuilds.
3. Zero "magic spells" - everything is completely explicit.

Tinybuild should suffice for small to medium sized projects.
